# Outsourced Sport Predictor - Decision Log

## Initial Data Collection
We first gathered data on the team results from the Euro and Nations League soccer tournaments. However, we collectively decided that we could not use this data because of how infrequent those tournaments occur, combined with how much the teams change from tournament to tournament. 

## Revised Data Collection
We decided to collect data based on the composition of the teams - namely player information and statistics. The data for the players can be found in the transfermarket dataset, details of the data can be found in the data report.

## Database Setup
After we gathered all of the data we needed, we set up the database. 

## Task Allocation
After we set up the database, we decided to split up the work into training the data model and creating the visualization. 
- **Piotr and Connor**: Worked on creating the model
- **Riccardo and Harry**: Worked on setting up the visualization
